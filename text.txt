- logout page is remaining to create 
- login logut navbar state updation problem remove 
- now a problem was created that i need to fetch food items from database but 
those images were stored in the admin react app in there backend folder so 
i needed to change port of admin backend server and store images with full location
or full path where  images were stored in the admin react app 'http://localhost:8080/uploads/images' 


task before login or register i can't watch food dishes and that should not be the case 
so the pnly thing i need to do is allow food dishes but don't allow to place order without login
